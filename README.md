# Casino Spin And Win Game.

### Note: This program does not in any way advocate for gambling. It has been done with the notion of practicing my Python skills in terms of data structures(Lists, Dictionaries) and algorithms.

The program is about a text-based slot machine for example, like the ones found in casinos. The user deposits a certain amount of money,
and uses it to bet on one of three lines. If they got the lines correct, then they win the bet, otherwise, they lose the bet. The lines
have been structured as a 3x3 matrix.

## Running the program.

You can run the program by using the following command:

```bash
$ python3 casino.py
```
